        Overall, this co-op was a very valuable experience for me. I learned so
        much from a development stand point, and I was also able to improve a
        huge amount on my React and CSS skills. I also learned a lot from a
        behavourial stand point, being able to improve immensely on my problem
        solving skills. In the end, I am very grateful to LINCS for providing me
        with this opportunity and thankful I was able to make meaningful
        contributions for them!
