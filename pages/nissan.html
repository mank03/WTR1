            <h2>Job Description</h2>
            <p>
                As a Vehicle Connected Services Co-op at Nissan Canada Inc., my role was centered around actively participating in the development and 
                testing of mobile apps and web portals. Working closely with a dedicated team, I had the exciting opportunity to contribute to the 
                creation of innovative solutions that enhance the connectivity and experience of Nissan and INFINITI vehicle owners. My top responsibilities 
                included collaborating on app features, engaging in testing procedures to ensure app functionality and improving current VCS processes
                using automation. 
            <br>
            <br>
                One of the unique aspects of my job was the opportunity to be hands-on with the vehicles themselves and directly engage in testing the 
                functionality of in-vehicle features and mobile apps. This experience allowed me to bridge the gap between software development and real-world automotive
                technology. My SQL skills were important, as it enabled me to interact with databases, extract valuable insights, and ensure efficient 
                data management. Proficiency in utilizing JIRA was essential for reporting issues, tracking progress of bug fixes, and validating them. 
                Collaboration was also key, as I actively participated in cross-functional teams, collaborating with developers, designers, and 
                marketing teams to achieve our shared objectives. My ability to contribute effectively in team settings and communicate technical 
                concepts clearly was pivotal in driving project success. Although I have learned these skills in class and from previous experiences,
                this role enabled me to leverage these for real-world applications. This combination of these skills was important in not only fulfilling 
                the requirements of the role but also in (literally) driving innovation for Vehicle Connected Services at Nissan Canada.

            <h2>Learning Goals & Reflections</h2>
            <p>
                I am delighted to reflect on successfully acheving the learning goals I had set for this term. My goals were closed tied to my job tasks, 
                and while some aspects of these objectives fell beyond my immediate job scope, I was determined to go above and beyond through collaborative 
                efforts with cross-functional teams and use of technological tools, I have expanded my skill set and accomplished these goals. The knowledge 
                and expertise I have gained, particularly in app development, vehicle connected technology, and automotive business operations, have not only
                enhanced my current role but will also certainly prove invaluable in my future automotive work experiences. Click on my learning goals below 
                to learn more:

                <p>
                    I led the EV Day presentation at the Vehicle Connected Services booth, collaborating alongside my coordinator Roma. All the positive feedback from colleagues, managers, 
                    and event attendees acknowledging the success of the booth and communicating the information, was incredibly rewarding. Additionally, I actively participated in 
                    volunteer opportunities, showcasing vehicles for the training team in collaboration with the Marketing Department. These experiences allowed me to demonstrate and 
                    further refine my oral communication skills, creating a clearer and more engaging interaction within cross-functional teams and events.

                <p>
                    Despite an increase in workload, I maintained consistent standards by completing assignments with the same level of quality. Utilizing Tableau and engaging in discussions 
                    with the IS team allowed me to make informed decisions and provide recommendations based on the outcomes of my assignments. Rather than solely delivering expected outcomes, 
                    I actively contributed to making recommendations and strategies, emphasizing the end goal and potential actions to be taken. Additionally, despite the increase in vehicle sales 
                    volume for particular models, I successfully managed and executed a larger quantity of in-vehicle messages, demonstrating improved proficiency in managing quantitative tasks 
                    amidst increased work demands.

                <p>
                    Enhancing my technological literacy has significantly elevated the quality of my work, through accuracy, thoroughness, and timeliness. Implementing advanced Excel operations in 
                    the VCS Availability Sheet using automation code, IF-ELSE statements, etc. enabled a notable improvement in task completion. Specifically, tasks that were previously expected by 
                    end-of-day were now consistently accomplished earlier, reflecting increased efficiency and time management. This elevation in technological literacy not only improved the quality 
                    of deliverables but also allowed for a more proactive approach to completing assignments, positively impacting overall workflow and productivity.

                <p>
                    Achieving proficiency in personal organization and time management has been important in refining my workflow. By allotting in-person tasks for the designated office days, I ensure maximum 
                    productivity during those moments. Especially since my role involves working directly with the vehicles to perform various testing and diagnostics during in-person days, I collaborate with 
                    my team members during those days to ensure effective and timely task completion. Moreover, I have written and updated the documentation for the upcoming intern through a structured and 
                    organized process, ensuring a smooth transition while demonstrating effective communication. Additionally, coordinating and organizing all aspects of EV Day planning alongside my manager 
                    showcased improved time management skills, ensuring a well-executed event while balancing other responsibilities. This has demonstrated my ability to balance and structure task management 
                    which has significantly improved overall productivity and quality.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                In conclusion, my first co-op work term at Nissan Canada has been a fulfilling and enlightening experience thus far. I am grateful I had the opportunity to learn many 
                new technologies and strengthen my skills with those I was already familiar with. Although some of the tools and frameworks I have used was new to me, I ramped myself up 
                and continued to push the scope of my work. If asked to describe the contents of my first co-op work term, I see my audience emphasizing the hands-on experience gained in 
                mobile app development process and testing procedures, the practical insights into vehicle connected services, and effectively collaborating with cross-functional teams to 
                acheive my learning outcomes. With four months of valuable experience behind me and an exciting four-month journey still ahead, I am excited to expand my knowledge and 
                broaden my skill set during this co-op, and I am enthusiastic about the positive impact these experiences will have on this second term as well as my future career within 
                the automotive industry.
