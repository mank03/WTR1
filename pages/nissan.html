            <h2>Job Description</h2>
            <p>
                As a Vehicle Connected Services Co-op at Nissan Canada Inc., my role was centered around actively participating in the development and 
                testing of mobile apps and web portals. Working closely with a dedicated team, I had the exciting opportunity to contribute to the 
                creation of innovative solutions that enhance the connectivity and experience of Nissan and INFINITI vehicle owners. My responsibilities 
                included collaborating on app features, engaging in testing procedures to ensure app functionality and improving current VCS processes
                using automation. 
            <br>
            <br>
                One of the unique aspects of my job was the opportunity to be hands-on with the vehicles themselves and directly engage in testing the 
                functionality of the mobile apps. This experience allowed me to bridge the gap between software development and real-world automotive
                technology. My SQL skills were important, as it enabled me to interact with databases, extract valuable insights, and ensure efficient 
                data management. Proficiency in utilizing JIRA was essential for inputting issues, tracking progress of fixes, and validating them. 
                Collaboration was also key, as I actively participated in cross-functional teams, collaborating with developers, designers, and 
                marketing teams to achieve our shared objectives. My ability to contribute effectively in team settings and communicate technical 
                concepts clearly was pivotal in driving project success. Although I have learned these skills in class and from previous experiences,
                this role enabled me to leverage these for real-world applications. This combination of these skills was pivotal in not only fulfilling 
                the requirements of the role but also in literally driving innovation for Vehicle Connected Services at Nissan Canada.

            <h2>Learning Goals & Reflections</h2>
            <h4> <i>Improve Documentation and Organization Skills</i></h4>
            <p>
                When I started, one of my struggles was around understanding where to pick up on our old test automation suite since no documentation existed for it.
                As this was my first time working in a corporate environment, documenting work through Jira tasks and Confluence was new to me
                so it became a goal of mine to fill the gaps in our documentation and improve my own organization skills in the process.
                I succeeded at this by creating detailed Jira tickets and Confluence pages so my supervisors could track my work.
                I created Confluence pages for each of my test suites where I outlined their purpose, test coverage, and provided relevant links to their Bitbucket repos and Jenkins jobs.
                I also documented setup and accesses required for the Robot development environment. I often had team members
                or coworkers from other teams reach out to me because they were interested in my work or wanted to learn more about Robot Framework,
                and they found this documentation quite helpful.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h4><i>Develop Skills in Robot Framework Test Automation</i></h4>
            <p>
                My first major project at The Co-operators was developing an enhanced daily health check for SPM.
                The existing health check was undocumented, not very robust, and written in Java.  At this point I had never
                done any test automation before, so starting from scratch was most efficient. I chose to start over in Robot Framework,
                a technology being used by another team who could provide some initial setup and technical support if needed.
                I began teaching myself Robot Framework and created a new daily health check with significantly more test coverage than before.

                As my skills with Robot grew, I expanded the scope of our regression testing from just a health check into
                testing full Workflows such as onboarding new agency staff, offboarding staff, and requesting e-signed documents.

                Towards the end of my term, I took my experience from the daily health check and created a similar test suite
                for my digital team.

                Of all my goals, this is the one I am most proud of and feel I found the most success with.  I feel confident
                in the test automation skills I've developed and my knowledge of Robot Framework.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h4> <i>Build Confidence Speaking to Large Groups</i></h4>
            <p>
                Presenting or speaking to groups has never been my strong suit, so I wanted a goal of mine to be building my confidence speaking to larger groups, especially senior members.
                One thing I did to help achieve this was occasionally offering to lead the daily stand up on my digital team. This helped me
                practice speaking in a structured setting. Besides this, the key to my success was learning to take ownership of my project work.
                Test automation in particular was something I could own and something only I could speak to, which helped me develop that confidence and recognize just how valuable my work was.
                Ultimately, I was able to extend the confidence I felt in my work to my presentations, and successfully
                gave demos of my regression test suites to both the greater SPM team and senior leadership team.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h4> <i>Develop Front-End Dev Skills</i></h4>
            <p>
                Towards the end of my second term, I was given the unique opportunity to extend the scope of my work from SPM
                into front end development for a digital team, Ctrl Alt Elite. I worked on enhancements to their Data Generator Tool,
                an Angular web app used to automate the creation of test clients and policies.
                My major contribution to the tool was adding a Changelog page to address major releases and an About
                page with routing to make the tool more user friendly. Through this work I was able to develop new front-end skills and a deeper understanding
                of Angular projects. Overall, this is one goal I feel I could have been more successful with.
                I felt there was still so much I had to learn, but unfortunately my work term came to an end! Regardless,
                this experience certainly helped me realize web development is something I'd love to try more of.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h4> <i>Mentor New Developer on Robot Framework</i></h4>
            <p>
                Mid October, a new junior developer started on the SPM team. One of my goals before the end of my term
                was to help him ramp up to ensure all my test suites and Jenkins jobs could seamlessly live on and be maintained after I was gone.
                To accomplish this, I took on more of a mentorship role and began sharing my experiences with Robot Framework and Jenkins,
                as well as collaborating on project work with him. I prepared additional documentation as a tips and troubleshooting guide
                for him to follow.  As his skill with Robot grew, I continued to delegate work and provide ad hoc support.
                By the end of my term, he was managing the test suites on his own and, based on feedback from my supervisors,
                is confident in his ability to troubleshoot and maintain the suites!
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h4> <i>Learn Agile Methods and Practices</i></h4>
            <p>
                During my work term I participated in an array of agile ceremonies, including demos, sprints, and retros.
                Each of my teams also held a daily stand up each morning where we gave updates on our Jira tickets and raised any blockers we might have.
                I was also given the opportunity to receive my Lean White Belt Certification.
                In short, Lean is a methodology that aims to eliminate waste (poor design, poor communication, etc.) to optimize
                the resources that go into activities that deliver value. The Agile methods used today were built off of Lean and the two can compliment each other.
                An easy way to think of it that I learned from my course: "Lean tells you what to build, Agile helps you build it."
                Overall, I was successful when it came to learning more about the methodology, giving demos of my project work, and learning to give concise updates at stand up.
                However, I didn't get the opportunity to participate in as many retros as I anticipated.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Overall, my 8 month work term at The Co-operators was extremely successful.  Test automation was new to me,
                but I ramped myself up and continued to push the scope of my work - I am proud of all that I achieved. My work for teams in both
                the Advisor Experience and Client Experience programs allowed me to learn a lot about the insurance industry
                and working in a corporate environment. I also had the opportunity to learn many new technologies
                and strengthen my skills with those I was already familiar with:
