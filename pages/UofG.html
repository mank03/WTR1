            <h2>Job Description</h2>
            <p>
                As a Vehicle Connected Services Co-op at Nissan Canada Inc., my role was centered around actively participating in the development and 
                testing of mobile apps and web portals. Working closely with a dedicated team, I had the exciting opportunity to contribute to the 
                creation of innovative solutions that enhance the connectivity and experience of Nissan and INFINITI vehicle owners. My responsibilities also 
                included collaborating on app features, engaging in telematics testing procedures to ensure app functionality and improving current VCS processes
                using automation. 
            </p>

            <p> One of the unique aspects of my job was the opportunity to be hands-on with the vehicles themselves and directly engage in testing the 
                functionality of in-vehicle features and mobile apps. This experience allowed me to bridge the gap between software development and real-world automotive
                technology. My SQL skills were important, as it enabled me to interact with databases, extract valuable insights, and ensure efficient 
                data management. Proficiency in utilizing JIRA was essential for reporting issues, tracking progress of bug fixes, and validating them. 
                Collaboration was also key, as I actively participated in cross-functional teams, collaborating with developers, designers, and 
                marketing teams to achieve our shared objectives. My ability to contribute effectively in team settings and communicate technical 
                concepts clearly was pivotal in driving project success. Although I have learned these skills in class and from previous experiences,
                this role enabled me to leverage these for real-world applications. This combination of these skills was important in not only fulfilling 
                the requirements of the role but also in (literally) driving innovation for Vehicle Connected Services at Nissan Canada.

                    Enhancing my technological literacy has significantly elevated the quality of my work, through accuracy, thoroughness, and timeliness. My team members have seen a notable improvement 
                    in task completion as I was able to implement advanced Excel operations in the VCS Availability Sheet using automation code, developing code with IF-ELSE statements, etc. Due to these technical enhancements during the internship, 
                    the VCS processes have been substantially optimized compared to before I joined. These improvements have streamlined the use of frameworks and documentations for the entire team and facilitate the next intern's work so it can allow 
                    them to complete their tasks more effectively as well. Additionally, tasks that were previously expected by end-of-day were now consistently accomplished earlier, reflecting my increased efficiency and time management. 
                    My improvement in technological literacy has also allowed for a more proactive approach to completing assignments that has positively impacted the overall workflow and productivity for the entire team.

            <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
            <p>
                I would like to sincerely thank my Managers Martha Turner, Pascale Leger, and Joelle Chartrand for continuing to encourage me, guide me, and for giving me the opportunity to join the team.
                They have made each day of this internship extremely valuable and has made this experience even more rewarding. Thank you to all team members and fellow colleagues 
                I met along the way who supported me and took an interest in my work!
            <br>  
            <br> 
                I would also like to thank Laura Gatto, Anne-Marie, and Kate McRoberts, my Co-op Coordinators at the University of Guelph, for their invaluable feedback during the co-op application period
                and their patient guidance in addressing my work-term inquiries. A special thank you to my Academic Advisor Greg Klotz for taking the time to read my work term report. I appreciate the 
                amount of time it takes to read through students co-op reports.
            <br>   
            <br>
                I also want to acknowledge that University of Guelph has been an amazing work environment. The entire team's openness and accessibility have fostered a collaborative 
                atmosphere. The dedication to innovation makes it an incredible institution! üôå
